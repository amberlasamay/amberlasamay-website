        <div class="subheading mb-5">Studentüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">	(I'm just copy pasting this from an essay I wrote this year) The song, Ballroom Extravaganza by DPR IAN, starts off with a good ten seconds of guitar. It feels sentimental, the intro being the sound of every chord being struck slowly. It draws out this sad feeling of nostalgia, and as soon as DPR IAN‚Äôs voice meets the instrumental, it sets the mood for an angsty sort of song. His singing is slow at first, starting in his lower register and making it seem like he‚Äôs talking about heartbreak. The whole song has parts like this, with his lowered voice sounding full of regret and pain. 

But these moments are also met with changes in the song, where the backing track becomes sort of upbeat. At first it would feel weird to have this sad feeling be met with upbeat sounds in the background, but his voice changes to sort of accommodate this. The song had started with a low, sadder type of singing, but now it has more power to it. He‚Äôs belting now, but keeps the same essence to his singing; you feel the words as they come, and it still draws out the same emotions of longing, pain, a broken heart. At some parts it even sounds as if it‚Äôs just an anguished yell, but it‚Äôs sung out so beautifully that it matches the energy of the dramatic instrumental. 
<br><br>

        Now, the lyrics almost perfectly match this dramatically sad mood he‚Äôs created. The first few lines describe an apocalyptic setting, with burning trees and when, ‚Äúthe world came crashing down.‚Äù This description kind of makes you think that the world is ending, with everything dying or stopping around the singer. Before this, he mentions that the world ‚Äústopped for you,‚Äù which makes this lean towards the initial assumption that this is a song about heartbreak. It sounds like he‚Äôs talking to someone, or focusing on them. 

A ballroom is a large room where dancing takes place, and extravaganza refers to an event, music, or action that is extravagant. With that in mind, the song can be imagined as the thoughts going through the singer‚Äôs mind as he‚Äôs dancing; he sees this ‚Äúyou‚Äù he‚Äôs referring to, feels all of these emotions as the world seems to end. It should also be noted that the world ‚Äúcrashing down‚Äù or ‚Äústopping for you‚Äù relates to how he feels about this person. Maybe they broke up, maybe something didn‚Äôt allow them to be together, or they just couldn‚Äôt continue the relationship anymore. At that moment, his world had ended, just as it was described in the early parts of the song. The extravagance of the moment could be from how much he‚Äôs focusing on this person, dancing and singing about them as the grief or heartbreak ruins his surroundings. 
<br><br>

       On the surface, the song already feels nostalgic, or at least sad in that way. It feels, like the lyrics insinuate, that something is ending, especially as the song ends with, ‚Äúwhen the story comes to an end, will you be the same again?‚Äù
